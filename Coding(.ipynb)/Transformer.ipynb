#Please, forgive me. since there is no time and recourses, I worked on kaggle interpreter, so the whole code will be available in one file. In future I will provide a version to work with code as py files in separate directories.
#So if you want to run this code, you have to run it on kaggle interpreter.

#Requirments 
!pip install neptune
